            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Off The Grid Energy was founded in 2018 with the mission of providing renewable and sustainable energy to the world. By providing energy that is collected from resources that are naturally replinished, we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and a chance to reduce air pollution.

                    <h4>Solar</h4>
                    <p id="desc">Solar panels use sunlight to generate electricity. With solar panels, you can help the US reduce its carbon footprint. Currently, we rank second in emissions. The benefits of solar panels can also help you to create energy independence from foreign sorces. Most importantly, you'll receive savings and the investment of solar panels will pay for themselves within ten years.</p>

                    <h4>Wind</h4>
                    <p id="desc">Small wind energy is powerful, renewable, clean, and can save you money. Depending on your location and the type of home wind system installed, you’ll typically see a return on investment in anywhere from 6 to 30 years. After that, the electricity the turbine produces will be virtually free. A home wind system is an excellent investment -- during the ROI period, your money is going to increasing the value of your home, rather than just spending money you’ll never see again on your monthly electricity bill.</p>

                <div id="geothermal">
                    <h4>Geothermal</h4>
                    <p id="desc">Geothermal energy is heat derived below the earth’s surface which can be harnessed to generate clean, renewable energy. This vital, clean energy resource supplies renewable power around the clock and emits little or no greenhouse gases -- all while requiring a small environmental footprint to develop.</p>
